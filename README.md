# Pixetch
[Pixetch](https://arpit-srivastava-one.github.io/pixetch/) is a simple drawing board where one can use their imaginative skills to draw pixel art!

This project is part of an exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch), with some of my personal additions and changes as well.
